## Key Frameworks
The analysis categorizes the workforce into four distinct segments:
* **Augmentable (Blue):** High Complexity / High Risk. AI acts as a "co-pilot," enhancing productivity for specialized roles like **Family Medicine Physicians**.
* **Stable (Red):** High Complexity / Low Risk. Roles requiring high emotional intelligence and non-routine problem solving, such as **Orderlies**.
* **Resilient (Orange):** Low Complexity / Low Risk. Physical or manual roles that remain difficult for current AI agents to replicate, such as **Carpet Installers**.
* **Vulnerable (Green):** Low Complexity / High Risk. Roles with high routine tasks susceptible to direct displacement, such as **Web and Digital Interface Designers**.

## Features
* **Interactive Wage Slider:** Dynamically filter the workforce by annual salary (starting at $30,830) to see risk distribution across income tiers.
* **Dual-Axis Mapping:** Quantifies the trade-off between technical automation capability and human cognitive demand.
